# React-Learning 🐱‍💻⚛️

This is a repository where I keep all my React projects divided in 2 sections.

### Mini projects
  - These are projects I've found on youtube, freecodecamp or a blog.

### React course
  - Here I have all the projects and exercises that I'll be doing while I'm learning React in a Udemy course.
